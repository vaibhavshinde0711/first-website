      The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league
      in India organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).[1]
      Founded in 2007, the league features ten state or city-based franchise
      teams.[2] The IPL is the most popular and richest cricket league in the
      world and is held between March and May. It has an exclusive window in the
      Future Tours Programme of the International Cricket Council (ICC),
      resulting in fewer international cricket tours occurring during the IPL
      seasons
